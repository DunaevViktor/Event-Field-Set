### Task:

1. You need to implement a dynamic form to edit and create records of the Event object.
2. The set of fields for the form must be set using the Field Set. We ignore the standard fields and their interaction with each other - it doesn't matter.
3. Additional fields with different types must be created on Event.
4. Use LWC or Aura components.
